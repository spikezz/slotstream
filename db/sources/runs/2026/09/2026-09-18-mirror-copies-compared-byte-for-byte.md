title: Both checkpoint copies compared byte for byte
tool: cmp
---
The mirror's whole premise is that both copies hold the same bytes, and
`requireIdenticalMirrors` does not establish it: at startup the engine compares
only each shard's size and its safetensors header, because a full payload
comparison on every run would cost a pass over 105.26 GB. This run does that
pass once, so the premise behind
[[records/measurements/mirror-reads-across-two-disks-2026-09-18]] has direct
evidence rather than only the indirect evidence of the generated text coming out
the same.

The two copies are the external NVMe at `/Volumes/llm/models` and the internal
SSD at `/Users/qian/.slotstream/models`, on
[[records/machines/mac-mini-m4-32gb]].

  else
    printf 'DIFF %s\n' "$name"; bad=1

[ $bad -eq 0 ] && echo 'verdict: IDENTICAL' || echo 'verdict: DIFFERENT'
```

verdict: IDENTICAL
```

Twelve shards, 105,240,154,212 bytes each side, no difference anywhere. The
loop covers every `.safetensors` file in the checkpoint; the remaining files in
the directory are the JSON index and the tokenizer, which the router never
reads through a mirror.

The comparison reads both copies at once, so it is also a crude concurrent-read
check: it completed without either disk returning an error.
