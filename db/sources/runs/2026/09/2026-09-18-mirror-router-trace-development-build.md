title: Mirror router trace on a development build
tool: slotstream run with the development router trace
---
The routing policy's own view of what it did, captured on a development build
that carried a debug trace behind `SLOTSTREAM_MIRROR_DEBUG`. The trace printed
one line per 20,000 claims with each replica's served bytes, read count,
measured throughput, busy time, reads in flight, and the distribution of the
queue depth observed at the moment each read was claimed.

**This run cannot be reproduced from the committed tree.** The trace was
removed before the commit, because nothing in the shipped code read its
counters and the repository's style rules do not keep an entity without a
caller. The binary that produced it was overwritten by the next build and its
hash was not recorded, so this run is evidence for the shape of the concurrency
and is deliberately not the source of any headline number. The shipped readout,
one `-- mirror split:` line at the end of a run, and the device-side witness in
[[sources/runs/2026/09/2026-09-18-mirror-iostat-device-witness]] are what a
reader can reproduce.

Two things in the trace matter. First, the two replicas converge on stable and
very different per-replica rates, roughly 3.0 and 1.4 GB/s, which is the
routing policy measuring the asymmetry of the two disks rather than being told
about it. Second, the depth-at-claim histogram shows that 86% of early claims
see a queue depth of exactly 10, and the distribution never spreads much past
that even though `SLOTSTREAM_POOL_QUEUE_DEPTH` is 32. The ceiling comes from
`concurrentPerform` over this machine's 10 cores, not from the pool setting, so
raising the pool depth alone does not put more reads in flight.

The digest line in this harness reads `d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e`, which
is the MD5 of an empty input. The harness extracted the generated text from the
stderr file, where the tokens are not, so the digest compared nothing against
nothing. It is kept here as captured. The working text comparison is the one in
[[sources/runs/2026/09/2026-09-18-mirror-decode-ab-three-rounds]], which hashes
the stdout file directly.
