// The prefill sweep's gates. A pass of 256 tokens or more streams each

// must hold for that to be the same computation: it stays inside the band
// that re-chunking a plain prefill already moves the logits by (the control
// prefix-check established), it is deterministic, and it is blind to what
// the pool holds — the golden-equivalence invariant, which for the sweep
// means the same bytes reach the same kernel whether an expert was copied
// out of the pool or read from the checkpoint.

        A lighthouse keeper on the northern coast kept a ledger of every ship that passed, \
        noting the weather, the hour, and whether the vessel answered her lamp. Over forty \
        years the ledger filled eleven volumes, and when the light was automated she donated \
        them to the maritime museum, where a curator found that the entries predicted storms \
        better than the almanac of the time. The museum now runs a small exhibit on the ledger, \
        with one page open to a night in 1911 when three ships turned back within an hour. \
        In a different field entirely, a bakery in a mountain town discovered that its sourdough \
        rose faster on days when the pressure dropped, and the head baker started reading the \
        barometer before deciding how long to proof the loaves. Customers noticed nothing except \
        that the bread was reliably good, which was the point. A physics teacher who bought bread \
        there every Saturday wrote the observation up for a hobbyist journal, with a table of \
        proofing times against pressure readings and a careful note that the sample was small. \
        Elsewhere, a municipal water utility replaced its paper inspection forms with tablets and \
        found that inspectors wrote shorter notes but photographed more, so the engineers who read \
        the reports learned to look at the pictures first. The utility measured the change by \
        counting how many follow-up visits each report triggered; the number fell by a fifth in the \
        first year and then held. A composer working on a piece for two pianos asked the players \
        to rehearse in separate rooms with a shared metronome, and only combine the parts in the \
        final week, so that each would learn to hold tempo without leaning on the other. The \
        premiere was tight and slightly cold, according to one review, and warm and precise \
        according to another; the composer kept both clippings in the score. On a farm that grows \
        seed potatoes for other farms, the rotation runs seven years, and the family keeps a map \
        of every field going back to 1952, with the varieties and the yields and the years a blight \
        got in. The map is drawn in pencil on butcher paper and photographed each winter. A \
        translator of technical manuals keeps a list of words that mean different things in the \
        two languages she works between, and adds to it whenever a reviewer flags a sentence; \
        the list has more than nine hundred entries and she reads it once a year, in January, \
        because that is when the work is slow. Finally, a small observatory that measures the \
        brightness of variable stars lets visitors take one measurement each on open nights, \
        and includes their numbers in the published series with a mark, and over a decade the \
        visitors' points have proven no worse than the staff's.
