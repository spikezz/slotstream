/// Routes checkpoint reads across byte-identical copies of the same model.
///
/// Every replica holds the same bytes, so any replica can serve any read.
/// Disks can have unequal throughput. With few reads in flight, splitting
/// evenly can be slower than using the fast disk alone: every second read
/// waits for the slower disk without enough other work to overlap it.
///
/// So this router does not balance. It estimates when each replica would finish
/// a read submitted now, as the bytes already queued there plus this read over
/// the throughput that replica has lately achieved, and submits to the earliest
/// finisher. Both ends of the concurrency range then come out right without a
/// threshold to tune: while the replicas are idle there is nothing queued and
/// the estimate is decided by throughput alone, so the fast disk takes
/// essentially everything; once it has a backlog the queued bytes lift its
/// estimate past the slow disk's and the surplus spills across.
///
/// Two properties of the measurement are what make this work, and both were
/// learned by getting them wrong first.
///
/// The throughput is measured in aggregate — bytes completed over the time the
/// replica had at least one read in flight — rather than from the duration of
/// individual reads. A single read's wall clock already contains the wait
/// behind everything else queued on the same disk, so an estimate built from it
/// gets worse the more work the replica is given, and multiplying it by the
/// queue counts that same wait twice. The first version did exactly that and
/// ran away: the internal disk took 2410 reads, measured itself at under
/// 5 MB/s because those reads had been waiting on each other, and was never
/// chosen again across the following 40,000 reads. The external disk was
/// meanwhile estimated at 0.10 GB/s while `iostat` showed it delivering
/// 2.1 GB/s. Aggregate throughput inverts that feedback, because giving a
/// replica more concurrent work makes it measure faster rather than slower, up
/// to its own ceiling.
///
/// A measurement also expires. A replica is only measured while it is being
/// used, so any reading that argues against using it is self-sealing: one
/// unlucky probe — the internal disk caught mid-stall behind the engine's own
/// startup allocations — excluded it for an entire run, and because it was
/// excluded the reading that condemned it was never revisited. Past
/// `measurementLifetime` an idle replica's reading is discarded rather than
/// kept, so the next claim measures that disk as it is now. The cost is one
/// probe per second per starved replica, against reads that arrive by the
/// thousand per second.
///
/// No device is described to the router. Each replica's throughput is learned
/// from its own completed reads, so a mirror across two equal disks balances
/// evenly, and a mirror whose fast disk degrades re-weights itself without
/// anyone re-measuring the hardware.
